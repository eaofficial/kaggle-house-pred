# kaggle-house-pred
This is a simple model of kaggle's Getting Started House Prices Prediction competition.
It predicts house prices based on some 80 features (some of irrelevant features were removed to avoid overfitting or high variance).
The dataset can be obtined from https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques
It does uses many linear models as well as Decision Tree and Random Forest.
Currently it is not fully optimised, I will try to make it as accurate as possible.
